Below is the chapter on Chernobyl from _Десять лет великих потрясений (Ten Years of Great Upheavals)_, which is the memoirs of Nikolai Ryzhov, first published in 1995. Ryzhkov was the Soviet Premier from 1985 to 1990 and the head of the Politburo Commission for handling the accident at Chernobyl NPP. Valery Legasov directly reported to him, Ryzhkov has traveled to the disaster scene for the first time on May 2, 1986 and spent two days on road trips visiting the contaminated villages of Ukraine and Belarus. He gives a striking eyewitness account from the head of government perspective, quoting from Legasov’s tape memoirs at times.

The 27th Party Congress ended in early March 1986. It didn’t pass without routine speeches and habitually loud phrases. But businesslike in general. I could already feel the turn from splendor and hype to comprehending the real situation in the country. It was not done loudly and with anguish -which became almost mandatory in the future- but the first attempts were made to answer the classic question: “What to do?”

What to do with the economy, which could no longer tolerate the transfusion from bare to empty: the bare needed to be given at least some content, and the empty filled at the very least. However, the answer to this question, as I have already said, was prepared by us long ago. So the Congress itself for us, economists and production workers, was simply a milestone from which we could start our lap.

And everything would have gone according to plan – even with inevitable adjustments on the side of the party and life. Yes, only fate once again sent the country a terrible ordeal. It is not for me to judge whether it is fair or not. Let me be subjective, but I am still sure: It did not deserve this, no! I always considered myself far from church rituals, and today I do not really understand the former party leaders who have taken the fashion to come to church on major religious holidays, to stand with long faces in front of images. If it dawned on you and you revised your philosophy of life so quickly, then believe in it internally, do not blaspheme. But then it seriously popped up: Why are you doing this to us, Lord!

April 26 fell on a Saturday. I was about to leave early in the morning for work, when the sharp bell of the “chopper” slowed me down. Energy Minister Anatoly Ivanovich Mayorets was calling.

“Sorry to bother you”, he said excitedly, “but it seems that there is an emergency at the Chernobyl nuclear…  
“It seems to be an emergency?” I interrupted. “Can you give more details?”

“I don’t know the details yet. We are contacting Chernobyl.”

I glanced at my watch.  
“In half an hour I’ll be in my office. I hope you have enough time to make the call and find out everything?”

They say that in the moment of danger, the sixth sense turns on.

I don’t know what switch flipped in me, but I drove to Kremlin and only thought about this call, counted the options. Alas, they all turned out to be immeasurably far from reality. Evidently a person subconsciously seeks to get away from the worst…

I entered the office and immediately pressed the button for a direct link to Mayorets.

“What happened there?”

“At 01:23 a powerful explosion occurred at the fourth block of the Chernobyl nuclear power plant, after which a fire started.”

I specified, still hoping for the best:

“Where is the explosion? In the engine room?”  
“No”, answered Mayorets, “In the reactor.”

The explosion in the reactor was scary. The fire in the reactor is even scarier. The night code signal from the station read: “One, two, three, four.” These numbers meant all types of danger: nuclear, radiation, fire, explosive. The consequences -immediate and outlying- were impossible to predict.

The still ambiguous situation in the small Ukrainian town so far demanded immediate action. Therefore, I ordered Mayorets to fly to Kiev without delay to get to the disaster site, and I myself summoned the Council of Ministers’ specialists.

At 11 am the decree for the creation of the Commission was signed. Meanwhile, the assistants were looking for the chairman of the Bureau for the Fuel and Energy Complex, my deputy Boris Evdokimovich Shcherbina, who had left for gas fields in the Orenburg region the day before. An emergency is an emergency: Shcherbina was found quickly. I briefly informed him about the explosion and the composition of the commission:

“Fly to Moscow urgently! The members of the commission will be waiting for you at the airfield, the plane is already being prepared, so to Chernobyl at once.”

At 16.00, a special flight left for Kiev from Vnukovo airport.

Here is what Academician Valery Alekseevich Legasov who also flew into the catastrophe on that hurried special flight dictated to the magnetic tape then:

“…It did not even occur to me then that we were moving towards an event of a planetary scale, an event that, apparently, will go down in the history of mankind forever, like the eruptions of the famous volcanoes, the death of Pompeii, or something close to that.”

It hadn’t occured to anyone yet, there was too little information, which, as it is believed, is the mother of intuition. However, my intuition (that same sixth, seventh, sixteenth sense!) was already hideously freezing my heart. Waiting and catching up are agonizing affairs. That evening I had to wait.

The commission got to Chernobyl at about eight in the evening. Shcherbina called me very late, told me about what had happened wearily and with anguish. In short: during a non-staff test of a turbine unit at the fourth unit of the nuclear power plant, two explosions occurred in succession. The reactor room was destroyed, several hundred people were hit by radiation, two were killed, the radiation situation was complex and still completely unclear.

He said that the Commission was working divided into small groups, each according to its own profile, but it was already obvious that it couldn’t be managed without the military. Helicopters were urgently needed, preferably heavy ones, chemical troops were needed, and as soon as possible…

It is important to note that the Commission found a completely demoralized leadership of the power plant and from that hour took over the entire management of the work. An iron will and professionalism was needed. A few years later, the jaunty TV journalist persistently drew out the “moment of truth” from the former director of the power plant in front of the TV camera, who agreed that those who violated the rules and instructions should have been imprisoned: Not he, but those who were in the Kremlin at that time. That’s it!

Defense Minister S. L. Sokolov was not there: He was on a business trip. I phoned the Chief of the General Staff, Marshal S. F. Akhromeev. I was glad he just took over the organization of the transfer of the required military units to the nuclear power plant. I liked his pedantic clarity, his reticence, the ability to get away from rushing and panic even in the most tragic situations, to do what is needed right away, and not to waste time on trifles. What was there to be surprised about? He was a military man! Unfortunately, I met other military men… I do not know to whom and what orders he gave, but by Sunday morning helicopter pilots and chemists were in Chernobyl. In the morning, the commander of the chemical forces, General V.K.Pikalov, flew there. Afterwards, for the elimination of this accident, he deservedly received the title of Hero of the Soviet Union. Going forward, I will note that Sergei Fedorovich Akhromeev and I have gone through our entire “Chernobyl epic”. I thank my lucky stars that it was he, and not someone else, who actually led the operation of the army, although formally the leadership was exercised, of course, by the Minister of Defense. But I have learned from my own experience the difference between the formal and the real.  

I’m running ahead again – even further, much further…

I am ashamed to even remember how the well-known “Warrior with privileges” at the Supreme Council of the USSR mocked this old man, a participant in the Patriotic War,_\[WW2\]_ Hero of the Soviet Union. Was it only she, mocked only him? Doesn’t she dream about him at night now? Forgive them, Sergei Fedorovich, maybe they really didn’t know what they were doing? How unfair it is that a combat marshal, battle-worn, who knew everything and understood everything, an intelligent and honest man, had to die so terribly in August 1991! Or was he forced to die? _\[Akhromeev committed suicide, which was speculated to be a murder, after the failed August coup in 1991. [See here for the details](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergey_Akhromeyev)\]_

… At night, B. E. Shcherbina called again. I told him about the conversation with Akhromeev, in response he informed about the decision of the Commission to urgently evacuate the residents of Pripyat, a city raised next to the power plant: the background radiation there exceeded the norm. I didn’t even think about sleep that night. Fortunately, the damned state of passive expectation was interrupted by Shcherbina’s business calls, which I downright rushed to, scaring my wife.

And at this time, buses were going along the night roads to Pripyat, more than a thousand of them. Ukrainian railroad workers brought three special trains to Pripyat. The commission, which included representatives of the regions neighboring Chernobyl on site, hastily determined the nearest points for the temporary resettlement of the evacuees.

The evacuation began on Sunday at 14.00, and exactly three hours later there was no one left in Pripyat. Forty thousand people left their inhabited homes, abandoned their households, properties collected for years, and went into the unknown.

On Monday the 28th a meeting of the Politburo took place. I reported on the first results of the work of the Government Commission. Naturally I talked about the evacuation. About the situation at the power plant: The fourth unit was destroyed, the third was shut down, the first and the second were working, although the radioactive contamination was quite high there.

The helicopter pilots, led by General Antoshkin, began to fly around the exploded block. They established that the reactor and the reactor hall were completely destroyed, pieces of graphite blocks were thrown by the explosion into open areas. A white column of smoke rose from the mouth of the reactor hundreds of meters up – apparently from the burning graphite – and a crimson glow was clearly visible inside the remains of the reactor.

The main question – whether the reactor continued to operate, that is, whether the process of accumulation of radioactive isotopes was going on – got answered negatively: Legasov got to the reactor in an armored vehicle and personally made sure that the reactor was “quiet”. But the graphite continued to burn, this process is long and extremely dangerous. The search was on for a means for reliable extinguishing…

It was clear to everyone that the situation was indeed an emergency, dangerous not just for Chernobyl. The ecology of the countries in the entire European zone was in grave danger. The next day, the Politburo Task Force was formed, taking control of the situation. I was assigned to lead the Task Force.

Now they can probably throw another stone at us: Saying another party-state bureaucratic formation instead of action. Saying it is not necessary to meet, but to act… Let me remind you once again: the trouble happened at the beginning of 1986, the authority of the Politburo was indisputable. Only its name could involve everything and everyone in the country, and the events, we understood, were moving towards that.

One example. Quite quickly, Shcherbina’s Commission (again, Legasov proposed) found a way to extinguish the reactor: Pelt it with lead from the air. And one phone call from me made all the trains carrying lead on the railroads of the country turn to Chernobyl. At once! And no one dared to object…

Yes, in trouble, in catastrophe conditions we know how to work, we know how to do everything that is necessary, without further ado. But, firstly, the country then in the last days of April 86 still had a poor idea of what the Chernobyl hell would bring along with it, it was still just beginning. The emergency in those hours existed only for those who understood the true state of affairs.

Even in Pripyat, the city of power engineers, weddings were celebrated on Saturday night,and the evacuation itself went easy, without much drama. Some of them even left in their cars: There was no radiation monitoring on the roads yet. In all fairness, I will add that by the day of the evacuation, the level of contamination in the city was still not too dangerous.

No, believe me, an experienced production worker who knew how to deal with the level of governing orders: If it is known that the Politburo is at the head, any executor of any rank will do everything unquestioningly and precisely. This is the “second” and the main thing… And no matter what they say now about the Politburo, it was a collective body. Its decisions were were subject to mandatory enforcement. Yes, the system was such. But forgive me for the sacrilege, thank God that Chernobyl happened not now, but back then…  

The task force met daily, and in the first days, twice a day. In the meeting room, HF radio was equipped with amplifiers so that all those present could hear the communications with Chernobyl. Any issue from this zone was resolved immediately. Everyone who could help us or suggest something, worked with us. Any request was satisfied at once. Today I look through the notes that I kept at every meeting according to my old habit: We have resolved more than four hundred specific issues. Or, to be more precise: Helped to resolve, made the solution possible.

I cannot help but quote the tape-recorder “diary” of Academician Legasov once again:

“I do not know of a single major or minor event that would not have been in the field of vision of the Politburo Task Force. I must say that its meetings, its decisions were of very calm and reserved character, with the maximum desire to rely on the point of view of specialists, but comparing the points of view of various specialists in every possible way. For me, it was an example of a properly organized work… At the same time, in its decisions, the Task Force always sought to follow the path of maximum protection of the interests of people.”

I daresay, the loyal love the academician who had untimely passed away held for the formal party body could hardly be doubted. Legasov’s words still remain the best reward for me personally.

Alas, but in the early days, civilian authorities very badly coped with the “protection of the interests of the people.” Medicine turned out to be simply unprepared for working in extreme conditions, when we had not even hours, but minutes. _\[Ryzhkov’s critical account can be seen in [the Politburo meeting transcript from May 5, 1986](https://itsmydutytotell.wordpress.com/2020/09/11/may-5-1986-politburo-meeting-transcript/)\]_ And again the military came to the rescue: the mobilization of reservists began, as is customary in our army, in the mothballed medical battalions, ready to instantly deploy in a state of emergency. It already was- they did not remember a bigger emergency. Five fully manned battalions have managed to do much of what civilian medics were supposed to do.

Was it sad for who entered the reserve battalions? Yes, the civilian doctors entered! What are we -let the military forgive me for the frank term- What are we, do we not know how to work without a stick? Is it the lack of composure? Responsibility? Discipline? It is good that the army has not yet lost all these qualities. However, now it is going towards the point of catastrophically losing these traditional properties. In it, as in all of our society, theft, corruption, and laxity are thriving. The army is part of society and cannot exist outside of it. And the defects of society are also its defects.

But this did not happen by itself. For several years now, the Russian army has been subject to purposeful discrediting and disintegration. A man in uniform has always been the last hope, mainstay and symbol of the protection of compatriots in our country. Now the army tanks are firing point-blank, direct shots at their own parliament… _\[He is referring to the [Russian constitutional crisis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1993_Russian_constitutional_crisis) in 1993\]_

Let’s return to the topic of the chapter. Our illustrious civil defense has just as ineptly slipped up. All these notorious activities with trying on gas masks and regarding the poorly drawn posters turned out to be unnecessary. It is rightly said: it was smooth on paper… In theory, our “geoshniks” were as established as they were, but in reality they drove sprinklers out of the infected streets to scrub the dust with brushes. We had to increase the number of military chemists in the affected area, and they did not disappoint.

There was, as one would expect, a frightening shortage of medicines. On May 1, if I am not mistaken, we decided to purchase them abroad. On May 5, the sellers were already found, and medicines began to flow into the country. I will allow myself to make a small digression from the chronology of events. We have just mentioned the purchase of medicines. Similar decisions were made on the acquisition of equipment abroad: robots, special cranes, chemical reagents, etc. And all this had to be paid for in foreign currency. We spent about 60 million foreign exchange rubles, or at the then exchange rate of 100 million dollars. _\[Ryzhkov is being modest and making a passing mention of it, however he did an epic act, which is detailed [in this documentary.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rv2ttzxe4P8)[\]](https://youtu.be/rv2ttzxe4P8)_

I was oppressed and resented by the overt cynicism of the Western “civilized” society. Not only did they not provide material support, but they did not even express sympathy. At that time they treated us like lepers. And only individual organizations, specialists and entrepreneurs offered their help.

A little later, in a conversation with Swedish Prime Minister I. Karlsson, I expressed my bewilderment. “You in the West must thank us,” I said. “No one is ever insured against planetary disasters, including in nuclear affairs. Our country and people have experienced all this horror, but we have accumulated invaluable experience that is needed by everyone, the whole world. What happened with us is our cross, and the fact that the West stood aside at that time is a matter of your conscience.”

… I do not like to lead only from a commanding chair, as is customary in our country. I always want to see with my own eyes what is being done. Information from Chernobyl was in a continuous stream. It was unlikely that anyone could have thought of hiding something. But information is just documents, telephone conversations… But some kind of anxiety did not leave me, sharpening without tiring: Do we know all, are we doing everything right? And then – just on May 1 – Ligachev, -he was a member of the Task Force of the Politburo- approached me with the same doubts. We decided to fly to Kiev the next day. Observing the chain of command, we reported our decision to the Secretary General. He immediately and actively supported us: Go, you will see everything on the spot.

To be honest, I expected that he -the head of the party and state- would also want to fly with us. But he did not even express any such desire. Even in the form of an assumption, he did not…

Digressing from the course of events, I want to ask myself a question: Why did Gorbachev show such a strange personal passivity? Why was he never in the burning Chernobyl? Why did he not come to the “hot spots” when they really became such? Neither Karabakh, nor Tbilisi, nor Sumgait, nor Baku, nor Vilnius…

After all, from the very first days of his reign, he intensively and successfully molded his own image as the people’s favorite. He approached people, talked to them right on the streets, although, to be honest, these conversations soon became boring in their monotony of a tape. He did not shy from press conferences. He felt easy under the telephoto lenses pointed at close range. He was able to, and wanted to please everyone.

And then, like something in the hedges… After all, it is clear to anyone how much human sympathy even a short -just a few hours- appearance in the very Chernobyl would have brought him! How much, by the way, would it add confidence to the Chernobyl victims themselves! Look, the “iron” Margaret Thatcher, so in love with Gorbachev – she never missed a single emergency in Great Britain: at the plane crash site, or the gunned down street of Belfast, her frail figure appeared everywhere. Her – a woman!

All the more, it happened just once – when a gas pipeline stretched next to the railway exploded in Bashkiria, and the explosion claimed hundreds of lives, crippled dozens of destinies. Right then Gorbachev, after my information, volunteered to fly with me to the disaster site! Why only once?

By the way, when Ligachev and I flew to Kiev, it turned out that neither the First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Ukraine, Vladimir Vasilyevich Shcherbitsky, nor his closest associates had ever bothered to visit the disaster zone for all these long days! We were expected? The only higher authority who had visited the zone before us was Valentina Semyonovna Shevchenko, Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Council of the republic. Evidently women respond faster to trouble. _\[Ryzhkov is apparently a feminist, which becomes obvious [in this interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BXtEIGDGkI) with Inga Legasova, daughter of Valery Legasov.\]_

We, I repeat, have arrived. And then I had to refuse to visit Kiev and insist on an immediate trip to Chernobyl. The faster, the better.

However, it didn’t work out like that. On the way, we stopped in those ecologically clean settlements where some of the inhabitants of Pripyat were evacuated. There were any questions from their side, naturally. But I will note a fact that now may surprise you: A distinct sense of calmness. Today, not without bitterness, I think: Calmness is just a child of ignorance. The explosion was outwardly terrible, but instantaneous. The main danger entered people’s lives slowly, not evasively, but absolutely invisibly. Discreetly. People were yet to realize the trouble.

I remember an old woman who sincerely complained to me: “I had to throw away such good potatoes! I wanted to take at least a bag – they didn’t give it, “dirty “, they said. And how is it dirty? Potatoes are potatoes… ” However, maybe I met this old woman the wrong time, maybe on my next visit. What’s the difference… How many people still do not understand in our country, underestimating the threat of radiation contamination! The current commercial operations with radioactive materials alone are worth something!

The headquarters of the Government Commission settled in the building of the district party committee. They were already waiting for us. Shcherbina, Legasov, Mayorets, Velikhov, Chairman of the State Hydromet Izrael, briefly spoke about the situation. Then the doctors spoke, the chemists spoke about their problems, or rather, about general ones.

Legasov is absolutely right in his memoirs: We were guided in everything only by the opinions of specialists. But there was one issue that had to be solved by us. By me. A large-scale map lay on the table, on which there was an uneven, unsightly blot – the Zone of dangerous radioactive damage, from where the inhabitants had to be evacuated. If you poked a compass needle into the point with the inscription “Chernobyl” and draw a circle with a radius of 30 kilometers, then the longest and thinnest “tongues” of the Zone would have touched it. It is true, within the outlined circle there were also places that did not fall into the Zone, where the radiation level, according to the information provided, made it possible to live…

Everyone was waiting for the decision. You could not afford to make a mistake. “We will evacuate people from the thirty-kilometer Zone.”

“All of it?” someone asked.

Until then, they have argued, proposed: Let’s not rush, let’s specify the boundaries of the Zone once again. They were nevertheless determined with some margins. In addition, the radiation reconnaissance by helicopter -and it could not have been done otherwise- was not the most accurate.

I always loved the saying: Measure seven times … Alas, but at that moment it did not fit the situation. There was no time left to measure seven times, we had to hurry. Saving money, cutting corners on the evacuations, on people’s health -This I could neither understand, nor accept. Better to play it safe, otherwise it’s not just more expensive, but worse for the people, it wouldn’t do.

“All of it!” – I resolutely finalized, “And start at once.”

When we returned to Kiev a few hours later, hundreds of empty buses were en route to the Zone: It seemed that the entire road from Chernobyl to Kiev was occupied by them. In the Zone, 186 settlements were to be depopulated.

Shcherbina left a day later. By that time, he had received a substantial dose of radiation. Then he would fly there more than once, he would fly until 1989, would add new Roentgens to that dark sum… Did they not ultimately shorten his life?

The so-called changeable composition of the Commission remained in the Zone. And it was headed in turn, after Shcherbina, Silaev, then Voronin, Maslyukov, Gusev, Vedernikov, Tolstykh, the Ukrainians Masol, Mostovoy… If I have forgotten anyone, do not blame me.

When the radiation situation stabilized by the fall of 86, and the work in the Zone entered an organized phase, the shift “vigils” have ceased.

In 1989, all those who, as they say, were not too lazy, who wanted to make a big political name for themselves out of the nationwide misfortune, were already “on duty” at Chernobyl. Their legion – “on duty”, competing in a childish game called “Who will shout louder”…

And in those early days, even the journalists who broke through into the Zone wrote about the tragedy mainly as only a grievous incident.

It, as many believed, would end well enough. Unfortunately, they were wrong. Should they be blamed? Or, according to the newest habit, will we call the partocrats to answer, who with all their might hid the bitter truth from the people?

Even a former prominent partocrat, and later on dressed in democratic clothes in time, Shevardnadze in his memoirs throws stones at his colleagues -members of the Politburo. Because of their inertia, in the first days of the catastrophe he could not immediately report everything about it to the world. Apparently he knew everything in those days, unlike us, those who every hour, every day, bit by bit, collected data, analyzed it and made conclusions.

One should not be surprised at such a statement. This man had gone through all the imaginable and unimaginable steps of climbing “up”, he is indeed an aerobatics ace -from the nationwide demonstration of kisses with the infirm Brezhnev at the congress to chaos and human blood in his native Georgia. He’s always right!

Recently it became known to me that Yuri Antonievich Israel was almost “slaughtered” at the elections in the Russian Academy of Sciences, only because at that time he was the chairman of the State Hydromet Committee and supposedly he was hiding the true radiation state from his superiors. And such games are being played by more than grown up uncles? Yes, even if he wanted to do it (I don’t know why?) it wouldn’t have worked out. Rechecking of all radiation data was carried out by the military, geologists, atomic scientists, etc. Take, dear doubting sirs, maps of the radiation situation for each day -and you will be assured. I think they have survived at the General Staff. And it was on the basis of such verified and rechecked data that the necessary decisions were made both in the Center and in the affected republics.

For example, I did not even think that “Aunt Klava” from a distant Siberian village needed to have data on radiation in Rems in some Belarusian village. I had no time to think about that erstwhile. Another “Aunt Klava” was a pain in my head. Thousands of them had to be taken from the Zone, settled more or less reasonably, clothed, fed, helped for rebuilding their lives.

Nor should we forget that it was only May ’86. No one has ever heard of such a cunning thing as “Glasnost”, although, by the way, this term was adopted as early as the February Revolution of 1917. _\[Glasnost was a term used for transparency, popularized by Gorbachev\]_

Subsequently, there were many complaints about the fact that data on the radiation situation in this or that area, in a particular locality, were communicated only to the leadership of these republics, and not published in the Far Eastern press, for example. They say to me: If there was Glasnost, how many lives could have been saved, how much human health could have been preserved! I wonder in response: How so? And so, they say that powerful public opinion would strongly influence all the high up bosses, so that they act faster and more efficiently. Having learned about the national disaster, the volunteers would rush to help Chernobyl from all over the country.

I can’t agree with that. There was no end of the volunteers in those days. There were thousands of letters asking to be sent to work in the Zone. Did miners and builders, power engineers and meliorators, physicists and geologists come to Chernobyl under a gun? Is it possible to count all of them ?! Who forced the participant of the Patriotic War, the “Afghan” General Valentin Ivanovich Varennikov and other generals, officers and soldiers to swallow the contaminated dust? It was not the lack of transparency, but human misfortune that pushed them there, to the detriment of their health.

Only a year or two later, the press started talking seriously and a lot about Chernobyl, albeit with “brute force”, with outright lies. Numerous public funds began to be created to help the Chernobyl victims, and people’s deputies of all stripes from different tribunes started to scream on top of their lungs at the entire television audience of the country that it was impossible to live not only in the thirty-kilometer Zone, but also in the three-hundred-kilometer one. A quote from the “Revelations of John the Theologian” about the star of Wormwood became known, as it were for the first time, since the publicist needed the place…

Let us stop! This is about the Chelyabinsk nuclear disaster in the distant and silent 50s, not only the country, but we, the neighbors in Sverdlovsk, knew nothing of. Fortunately, Chernobyl has never been a secret. And then, when it was completely opened wide… Are there enough volunteer doctors, and not volunteers – just doctors in district children’s hospitals somewhere in Belarusian Khoiniki near the Zone? Have sovereign states now have more houses, apartments, jobs for Chernobyl refugees? Has the current Glasnost put a stop to the theft of funds allocated for the victims by the Russian Government?

No, Glasnost alone cannot decide anything on its own. It alone -pardon me- is ranting. And those who want and can are doing the work, scream or don’t… Yes, we did not scream about Chernobyl that year. Perhaps in vain. Maybe it was indeed necessary to speak out: The people’s misfortune in all ages had been shouted out until the screamers got tired and took up axes and saws, to rebuild what was destroyed.

Now I look back ,thinking: What was not done? There are many things that cannot be enumerated! And what has not been fulfilled, out of what was needed to be absolutely, first and foremost fulfilled? I can’t remember: Everything was done! I will list it very briefly, no need for longer -volumes have been written about Chernobyl.

Putting out the fire in the reactor… Done already on May 10. The helicopter pilots threw sacks of lead exactly into the burning mouth, worked as snipers, countless tons of metal went into the fire, and there was a lot of it -trains arrived on time.

Academician Velikhov predicted the danger of molten combustion products penetrating into the ground, and then into the groundwater. Volunteer miners in just forty-five days, together with their minister Mikhail Ivanovich Shchadov, laid an underground passage under the base of the block and dug a huge space under it, for filling with concrete and constructing a cooling system. Fortunately, this was not necessary. But do I have the right to consider the work of miners superfluous? Never!

There was -no longer theoretically predicted, but absolutely real danger- of a washout of radioactive dust by summer and autumn rains, and subsequently by spring floods, from the surface layer of the earth into many rivers, rivulets and, most importantly, into Pripyat, and beyond it -the Dnieper.

The “condemned by all” Ministry of Water Resources and one of its leaders, P.A. Polad-Zade, (it was he who was “hacked to death” as the minister by the People’s Deputies in 1989) presented a plan of nothing less than incredible finesse for the embankment of all waterways of the huge region. And together with the army he carried it out! 130 large and small dams were built on an area of 1.5 thousand square kilometers. Pripyat and Dnieper stayed clean.

It was necessary to figure out to where the thousands of evacuated families would live. In Kiev itself, 7,500 apartments were allocated (alas, but the queue was suspended), in Chernigov – 500, in the Kiev region – 6,000 detached houses.

It was necessary to firmly bury the explosion site oozing death. The construction was designed, aptly named afterwards “The sarcophagus”. My deputy, Yuri Petrovich Batalin, was eager to go to Chernobyl, but at the insistence of the doctors, we did not allow him to go there. It was he who submitted the project with such an ancient Greek name.

For the first time in the world, in the most difficult radiation conditions, a truly fantastic structure was built, which took 400 thousand cubic meters of concrete, 7 thousand tons of steel structures. The most accurate radiation sensors in its giant body began to work already at the end of 86th. Essentially, the builders of the sarcophagus had sacrificed themselves. Now many of them have already passed away.

Medicine … We understood that Chernobyl was long-lasting, for generations. We were in a desperate hurry, trying to make it. 5.4 million underwent initial compulsory prophylaxis, half a million people were put on permanent dispensary registration.

Do not take this dry and well-known information for an attempt to convince the reader that everything was done in general. We perfectly understood that there is much more to be done than done.

Chernobyl hit the just reviving economy on a grand scale, hit it mercilessly. Let me remind you: Then there was Armenia. _\[Spitak earthquake disaster, see [here for the videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOsSyCpQHktzSQttKKV6OxD2GDpiM75j5)\]_ It is a whole different conversation. Later, the country began to fall apart. Plans and conceptions collapsed. Politics and the elements attacked the economy, strangled it, tore it to pieces …

But I am talking about the first days and the first months of trouble, I remember them, I sort through them like pebbles in my palm, and I cannot find out: Where did we go wrong then? What was not picked up? Where did we not step? Once again, I’m talking about the beginning. Another digression.

I have already written here that time and again life has laid “firing points” on our way, the embrasures we had to protect our chests from. Often they were created by our leaden fate: The civil war, the Great Patriotic War -that is from a number of global catastrophes. And there were the lesser: Crop failures, droughts, earthquakes, floods. But many, too many we have built against ourselves: Mass collectivization, “state economic activity”, ubiquitous sowing of corn… All this was one way or another on the people. Chernobyl combined both options: We built it ourselves, we treated it disrespectfully and it took revenge on us with a catastrophe that tragically affected both people and nature, and continues to threaten not only the present, but also future generations, the flora and fauna of many countries…

“N. I. Ryzhkov said in his speech on July 14 that it seems to him that the accident at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant was not accidental, that the nuclear power industry was heading with some inevitability towards such a difficult event.” I quote not from my notes, but from the memoirs of Legasov.

Yes, indeed, I said it at the Politburo. I said and had grounds for that. The Chernobyl disaster happened six months into my premiership. But before that, I had often attended meetings of the government, got acquainted with various notes, publications of scientists and specialists, and felt that the vigilance of scientists, builders, and operators had dulled. With this terrible energy they stopped talking in “you”. It punished us.

And as soon as the country heard the Chernobyl thunder, as soon as another embrasure breathing death appeared on the way, we rushed once more to close it with the whole world, as if nothing else existed. People did not think about money, or themselves, or even their loved ones. Quarrels and strife were immediately forgotten, everyone rallied and fought hand in hand.

I have already told how the trains turned to Chernobyl on a phone call, how our foreign trade instantly worked, when it was necessary to urgently purchase medicines and equipment. I can give dozens of examples of accurate, fast and coordinated work of all republics, different ministries, departments, factories.

But why does this precision, speed, and consistency necessarily require trouble? Why, as soon as the order “Don’t retreat!” loses its relevance, everyone immediately calms down and works wibbly-wobbly as usual? Why aren’t we able to work conscientiously in peace and quiet? What is it? Is it the fault of socialism again? Or the command-and-control system? Or an indestructible sign of national character? Then again, in many respects these are rhetorical questions…

I again flew to Chernobyl on August 8 with a member of the Commission, Viktor Mikhailovich Chebrikov._\[Head of the KGB\]_ Now we have already thought about tomorrow. Together with scientists and specialists, we planned when it would be possible to start up the first and second blocks of the station, when the third block would start working – and whether it would work at all. We were already looking for a place to build a new city of power engineers in place of Pripyat, which would be named Slavutich.

In those days, I was not only on the Ukrainian territory of the disaster, but also on the Belarusian one, which suffered even more. We watched the construction of settlements for the evacuees, and were already openly happy that -to quote the words of Gorbachev from his much belated May 15 speech -“the worst is over.” But then no one really knew how painfully Chernobyl would affect the health of thousands of Belarusians, Ukrainians and Russians tomorrow. The understanding had not yet come that almost none of those deprived of their home would ever be as happy anywhere as they were in their home.

Well, and, of course, no one probably imagined that the nationwide misfortune could be used to create a name and fame for oneself, to gain an unexpected position, replicating the misfortune in films and books, making mad money – without doing anything for a particular child, village or hospital.

Recently, a ponderous book by a writer and omnipresent lady from the presidential entourage saw the light of day, in which she used the minutes of the meetings of our Task Force. How much rage in this “work” in relation to those who died prematurely, climbing into the inferno of Chernobyl hell. Even enemies are more respectful towards their most fierce adversary.

The ninth anniversary of the tragedy is behind. I hoped that during this time there would be some rethinking of everything that had happened. Nothing of the sort. And I promised myself that in such an environment, this chapter of the book will be my last publication on this topic. I just want to say: “Stop. Cool it down. You will hurt your throat. And are you not ashamed?..” They are not ashamed. They always “know how to do it.” Did they bring the suicide of a person whom I respected immensely, whose knowledge and talent I admired, who in many respects solved the problem of block number four – Academician V.A. Legasov?

If you want – call it another digression. A digression about vileness.

The time had come to reward the heroes. There were many of them in Chernobyl, as in every war. Helicopter pilots, chemists, firefighters, nuclear scientists, workers, scientists. I do not know what will become of our orders and medals, whether it will be honorable or shameful to bear the title of Hero of Socialist Labor tomorrow and whether the authorities will replace it with the title of Hero of Capitalist Labor. And with the Order of the October Revolution, everything is clear: It will become the Order of the August or December Counter-Revolution, or even the Devil’s October. I am sure that someday such awards will not be a sign of honor and heroism, but a symbol of betrayal and shame.

But at that time people still valued orders and medals. They rejoiced when they had the honor to receive a government award for good work, heroic deed, self-sacrifice. Lists of candidates for awards were compiled locally. By tradition, the Politburo approved only awards for “big bosses”. But seriously, we have decided not to include members of the Task Force and deputy chairmen of the Council of Ministers among those to be awarded. Fortunately, the times when members of the Politburo hung stars on each other’s chests were gone. How, tell me, was it possible not to reward the commander of the “Chemists” General VK Pikalov, who spent day and night around the fourth block? How could one not reward the “Miners’ minister” MI Shchadov, who himself did not get out of the tunnel under the block?

We began to look at the list. We read the names – what the hell? There is no Legasov. Why? They vaguely explain to me that he is supposedly the deputy director of the Institute of Atomic Energy, which designed the exploded reactor. How, they say, can you reward him… They will not understand, they say… Our commission would not back down. When the team of Academician A.P. Aleksandrov designed this reactor, Legasov was nowhere near the institute. He’s been there recently. He has nothing to do with the reactor at all, he is an expert in physicochemical processes. He managed to extinguish this reactor in the end! I convinced them. Everyone supported me. He was included in the list and submitted to the Presidium of the Supreme Council of the USSR.

And rumors cannot be held back. They said that at the Institute, they already congratulated Legasov for the title of Hero of Socialist Labor, which we submitted him for. And then the decree was published in the newspapers with the list of the awardees, but Legasov was not on that list.

I am a calm person in principle. I rarely explode, but this time I could not help it. I went to see Gorbachev with a number of comrades: Where did the academician disappear, who struck him out of the list? Gorbachev, looking to the side, began to give all the same dusty arguments: “They will not understand,” “The time is wrong.” Then he kind of let it slip: The scientists themselves do not advise. And he summed up the conversation: The train, as they say, has left, and we will reward Legasov later for something else. By the way, on the occasion of his 50th birthday, Minister Yefim Pavlovich Slavsky expressed gratitude and presented him with a watch.

We, the participants in the conversation, left repressed. That is the price of the Secretary General’s heartfelt words about the people’s misfortune, human misery, the courage of heroes, the power of science! Well, it was necessary to believe the “confidants” who were deftly able to wash up under the wing of Man No. 1! I guess which of the scientists close to Gorbachev at that time “did not advise” him to reward Legasov. But I am silent about the guess. Alas, innocent until proven guilty. _\[See [this video interview](https://youtu.be/QceuKMS6OxM) where he recounts the details\]_

As already mentioned, Chernobyl unexpectedly and powerfully hit our still ailing economy. It was with Chernobyl that the attack on nuclear energy began in essence. A senseless and extremely harmful attack instead of deep analysis of the causes and sound problem solving. In France, the USA, Japan and other countries, many nuclear power plants operate quite successfully right in the cities.

Chernobyl has mercilessly swept through the fates of thousands of people, and how many more will it find, catch, finish off! It left a heavy mark in my life.

Not so long ago, the Ukrainians had decided to shut down and mothball the power plant. The reason was an event that completely refuted the theory, according to which the shell does not hit the same crater twice. In our country, shells are aimed at one and the same crater: There was a fire again at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant.

Times are changing rapidly. Real life with its problems and hardships forces us to reconsider seemingly removed questions. The de-mothballing of the Armenian nuclear power plant is already underway, the intensity of flames has decreased in Ukraine. But, despite the “healing” properties of time, it will take many years for the atomic fear syndrome to disappear.

Chernobyl is not only and not so much an explosion. Not only and not so much radiation and everything inevitably and terribly associated with it. Not only and not so much the issue of atomic energy. Chernobyl is a moment of liberation for the dense human instincts, abruptly involved in the primordial fear of the Invisible, the Unfamiliar, the Unknown.

We could not imagine much when we extinguished the fire in the reactor and rescued those who obviously could have suffered. Well, for example, you could hardly imagine such an incredible intensity of political struggle, which at some moments would grasp huge masses of people, even small children. But in the heat of this struggle, the powers that be of this world are not about the common man, even if his fate and life are in danger. Everything is in motion. Anything can become a trump card – even fear, which, of course, was born in those truly tragic April-May days. To quiet it down, to calm people down – psychotherapy as a branch of medicine, even the current destroyers of everything -and they have not yet been able to abolish all- do they really care about human peace in the political struggle? Well, them fighters, fight for high ideals!

Fear was noticed and adopted by them, spun into an extraordinary, incredible force. Attributed to all imaginable and unimaginable enemies of the “democrats”, the communists first of all, who, they say, have always led the country to catastrophe. Especially if it is man-made. And the name of that fear was given once and for all: Chernobyl.

In 1992, I was invited to see an investigator from the General Prosecutor’s Office. It turns out that I was not quite right when I said that the “democrats” are confronting the communists for what happened in Chernobyl. It turned out that the case was initiated on the instructions of the communist Gorbachev against the wrongdoers -communists, who, having gone through Chernobyl, had the audacity to stay alive. By inheritance from the USSR, the case passed on to Russia. At the necessary moment, this topic is activated. I don’t know how long to wait for the new surge.

The interrogation lasted for about five hours. Dozens of questions rained down on me. Whom do I personally blame for insufficient measures to eliminate the accident? Nobody! Meaning the system is to blame? The people who incompetently operated the power plant are to blame! _\[Ryzhkov was literally tortured in these interrogations, see my notes below\]_

The baton was taken up by the prosecutors of the CPSU at the Constitutional Court. The presidential prosecutor “mister” Colonel Kotenkov, who had overlaid himself above the top of his head with volumes on Chernobyl, in a rehearsed army voice, persistently asked questions about Rems and Curies in general and in specific villages in particular.

I stood in front of him and thought: Where were you at that time? Why didn’t you volunteer there, into the hell? Maybe he wouldn’t ask me stupid questions right now. He and his ilk had no moral right to be accusers of those people who considered it their civic duty to calm down the element that had escaped from the hands of man. I answered this audience for several hours. But soon after the trial I saw Kotenkov on television, already in a general’s uniform. After all, he received his silver coins for the length of service at the trial.

Years have passed, and from the height of what I have learned, been through and considered, I ask myself the questions today: Maybe it was not worth striving to make the Chernobyl power plant work at all costs? Maybe there was no need to spend a lot of money on its restoration, on the construction of Slavutich – a new, from scratch, city? Maybe these marginalized power engineers should have found other jobs or been placed at other nuclear power plants? Maybe we should have made a strong-willed decision: To extinguish the reactor, erect a sarcophagus over the block and… close the Chernobyl nuclear power plant? Forget about it. Put it behind.

And there would be no need to constantly prove to anyone -as if making excuses- that the power plant itself is safe. That nuclear energy is promising, and the world experience here is highly evident. That in lousy hands, a moonshine apparatus can still explode. That those lousy hands can happen to conservatives, democrats, communists and anarchists alike. And no regime, no system has any guarantee against misfortune born of chance or stupidity, fate or mismanagement…

And fear would not rise to heaven. And it would not become an instrument in evil and ruthless unclean hands. And people would live, forgetting about past nightmares.

Questions, questions…

I wonder how the blessed memory of Valery Alekseevich Legasov would answer them?

**My notes:** First of all, it was no easy task to translate this chapter. Google translate, which can be used as a crutch to speed things up, has failed half of the time, therefore it required a lot of manual typing and carefully searching for the correct expressions to avoid ruining the flow. Ryzhkov writes in an artistic literary, and at times poetic style, which can be difficult to translate in places. It wouldn’t sit right with me not to make an effort to do the proper justice to his stellar writing. It is a real shame this book was never translated to any language, it merits translation not only for being a priceless historical record offering a unique perspective personally written by the second top authority of the Soviet Union, but also for its incredible literary value, evoking the medieval Byzantine chronicles of distinguished literary quality.

Ryzhkov quotes from the [Legasov tapes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwOpUGgHpyc) in this chapter and also some interviews where Chernobyl is discussed. Legasov also quotes Ryzhkov in his tape memoirs and gives high praise to his articulation. They were in complete agreement that Chernobyl was no accident, but the Soviet Nuclear industry in its complacence and laxity was headed there, it was inevitable. It is quite evident in the damning 1979 report by the late Secretary general and former KGB Chairman Yuri Andropov, which you can read [here](https://itsmydutytotell.wordpress.com/2020/12/01/yuri-andropovs-report-about-the-severe-negligence-in-chernobyl-npp-construction-in-1979-when-he-was-the-kgb-chairman/).

Ryzkov answers the unfair criticism his administration and the scientists involved in the liquidation had received in this chapter, also in more detail in this two part video interview filmed in 1998. See [part 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQmwohfrg9I) and [part 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QceuKMS6OxM).

As for the hours long interrogation where he was accused with bogus things, he details that in another chapter in the book, and quotes the dialogues he had with the prosecutor. I can’t recall if it was this or an earlier interrogation, but he had barely recovered from a heart attack and was forced to stand for hours, not allowed to have a lunch break, psychologically tormented with a flood of accusatory questions. Perhaps this should also be translated, at least in part, to reflect the attitudes and general atmosphere regarding Chernobyl in the beginning of post-Soviet era.
