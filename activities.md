The _Galileo Project_ research group will aim to identify the nature of UAP and _‘Oumuamua_\-like interstellar objects using the standard scientific method based on a transparent analysis of open scientific data to be collected using optimized instruments.

**The _Galileo Project_ follows three major avenues of research:**

1.  **_Obtain High-resolution, Multi-detector UAP Images, Discover their Nature_**:

A picture is worth a thousand words. For example, a megapixel image of the surface of a human-scale UAP object at a distance of a mile will allow to distinguish the label: “Made in Country X” from the potential alternative “Made by ETC Y” on a nearby exoplanet in our galaxy. This goal will be accomplished by searching for UAP with a network of mid-sized, high-resolution telescopes and detector arrays with suitable cameras and computer systems, distributed in select locations. The data will be open to the public and the scientific analysis will be transparent.

We anticipate extensive Artificial Intelligence/Deep Learning (AI/DL) and algorithmic approaches to differentiate atmospheric phenomena from birds, balloons, commercial or consumer drones, and from potential technological objects of terrestrial or other origin surveying our planet, such as satellites. For the purpose of high contrast imaging, each telescope will be part of a detector array of orthogonal and complementary capabilities from radar, Doppler radar and high-resolution synthetic aperture radar to high-resolution, large camera visible range and infrared band telescopes. If an ETC is discovered to be surveying Earth using UAP, then we have to assume that the ETC has mastered passive radar, optical and infrared technologies. In such a case, our systematic study of such detected UAP will be enhanced by means of high-performance, integrated and multi-wavelength detector arrays.

**_2\. Search for and In-Depth Research on ‘Oumuamua-like Interstellar Objects_**:  

The _Galileo_ _Project_ research group also will utilize existing and future astronomical surveys, such as the future Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST)[\[1\]](https://projects.iq.harvard.edu/#_ftn1) at the Vera C. Rubin Observatory (VRO), to discover and monitor the properties of interstellar visitors to the Solar system.

We will conceptualize and design, potentially in collaboration with interested space agencies or space ventures, a launch-ready space mission to image unusual interstellar objects such as _‘Oumuamua_ by intercepting their trajectories on their approach to the Sun or by using ground-based survey telescopes to discover interstellar meteors.

**_3.  Search for Potential ETC Satellites_**:

Discovering potential 1 meter-scale or smaller satellites that may be exploring Earth, e.g., in polar orbits a few hundred km above Earth, may become feasible with VRO in 2023 and later, but if radar, optical and infrared technologies have been mastered by an ETC, then very sophisticated large telescopes on Earth might be required. We will design advanced algorithmic and AI/DL object recognition and fast filtering methods that the _Galileo_ _Project_ intends to deploy, initially on non-orbiting telescopes.
