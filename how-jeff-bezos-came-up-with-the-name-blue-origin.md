What’s in a name? A little thought and a good cause, according to Jeff Bezos who was recently pressed about why he named his space company “Blue Origin.”

The Puget Sound region is one area slated for massive growth in the coming space economy. Other local companies are already aiming for asteroids to mine. Companies like Blue Origin are specializing in transportation.

In May, Bezos unveiled Blue Origin’s latest model — the Blue Moon Lander. The Associated Press reports that the lander is the size of a small house and is intended to carry rovers to the moon. A yet-to-be revealed updated version could take people. The company also has a vertical takeoff and landing spaceship called the New Shepard, and an orbital rocket called the New Glenn.

## Blue Origin vision

Blue Origin sent out a highlights reel of Bezos’ fireside discussion Friday, providing some insight into his vision for his space company, and the emerging space economy. He argues that getting to the moon can’t be done without government support and knowledge. He also says that there won’t be just one company to enter space, but many “not just Blue Origin, it will be collaborative.”

“The real problem with doing interesting things in space is that the price of admission is so high that you can’t have that kind of entrepreneurial dynamism that I witnessed up close, and all of us witnessed happen on the internet on the last two decades … we don’t have the infrastructure to do that in space today,” Bezos said. “If you are in your dorm room, you are not going to start an interesting space company. The starting price tags to do really interesting things in space are hundreds of millions of dollars, going quickly to billions.”

“But if we had reusable space vehicles, that would start to change everything,” he said.

Bezos says that the moon will be an excellent base for space travel. He points to water that is frozen in the shadows of the moon, which can be harvested to make rocket fuel.

“We know one day that we will be refueling (the Blue Moon Lander) on the surface of the moon, from propellants made on the moon, from that water ice,” he said.
