The Tunnel Walk, which began in 1994, has become an integral part of Memorial Stadium’s game-day experience. It was created as a way for fans to share in the excitement of the team emerging from the locker room, something only a few could do before HuskerVision’s cameras and big screens came to Memorial Stadium.

The sounds of the Alan Parsons Project’s “Sirius” and the roar of the 90,000 frenzied fans rock the stadium as the Huskers burst through the locker room doors and into the tunnel on their way to the Memorial Stadium FieldTurf.


The players emerge through the Tunnel Walk Gates located in the northwest corner of the stadium. The gates are guarded by members of the Nebraska National Guard service units and opened by specially selected service men and women each game.

From 1994 through the 2005 season, the Tunnel Walk began in the former varsity locker room in the South Stadium, and the Huskers burst onto the field from the southwest corner.

With the completion of the Tom and Nancy Osborne Athletic Complex in the summer of 2006, Nebraska’s locker room returned to its original home in the North Stadium, causing the shift in the Huskers’ entrance from the southwest corner to the northwest corner of the field.

While walking down an interior hall in the Osborne Complex toward the field, the Huskers all raise their hands to touch the lucky horseshoe that hangs above the door as the Huskers leave the North Stadium. The same horseshoe hung in the South Stadium tunnel, and before that the horseshoe hung above Nebraska’s locker room entrance in the original North Stadium.


As they pass under the horseshoe, the Huskers step onto specially designed red FieldTurf that takes them on a winding path to the edge of the field. Nebraska’s “Big Red Carpet” is lined with screaming fans who helped the Huskers get revved up for action as they approach the gates. The entire walk to the Gates is filmed by HuskerVision and shown to the Sea of Red inside Memorial Stadium.


In 2006, as the anticipation built for the team’s entrance into the stadium, college football broadcasting legend Keith Jackson played a part in welcoming the Huskers onto the field. Not only is the Tunnel Walk for each season new and special, but the HuskerVision screens provide new features for the Tunnel Walk for each game during the season.
