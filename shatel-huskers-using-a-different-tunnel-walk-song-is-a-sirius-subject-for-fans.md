Taking stock of our sports world and what I learned from the Nebraska spring game:

» I learned that fans pay attention to the Tunnel Walk song — and might have to learn a new one.

Last Saturday, Scott Frost led the team out of the tunnel at Memorial Stadium to a version of the Beatles’ “Come Together.” You probably wouldn’t be surprised that this got a big response.

Shot Kleen, the associate athletic director for HuskerVision, said on Monday that his department decided to change it up to recognize Frost’s first appearance as coach.

Was this a one-time thing? Or a chance to make a break with tradition with a new coach and start a new traditional song to the team entry?

It’s a touchy subject. The Tunnel Walk, with the Alan Parsons Project song “Sirius,” began in 1994. Frost ran out to it during his career. Many Nebraska fans associate the tradition with great memories. Winning.

Kleen said, “We are going to take a look at it this summer and evaluate it, and we’ll make a decision as we get closer to the season.”

I did a Twitter poll on the subject — because this is serious journalism — and after 1,400 votes, it was 61 percent to 39 to keep "Sirius."

Stay tuned for breaking news on this topic.
