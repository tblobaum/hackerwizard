### How to buy this synthesiser.

The price inflates by 2% for every sold unit _(you can also by a more expensive unit if there are still cheaper ones available)_.

If there is no name under owner that specific unit is probably still available for that price. If you want to buy it send me a [email](https://www.gieskes.nl/p_contact/) with the #.. number. _(for orders inside the EU there wil be 9% VAT added, for orders outside the EU there will be 5.5% PayPal fee added, shipping is free)_.
